#Fault Identification of Ball bearing using Stockwell Transform, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Convolutional Neural Network-based Feature extraction

Bearing Fault identification using vibration signals has been an extensive research subject in the field of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis over the past few decades. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown a great application in areas with small datasets, where collecting more data is often cost-prohibitive, and time and resource-consuming. In the present study, Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) have been used to generate artificial images by feeding images generated using Stockwell transform. The image features are then extracted by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are then fed to traditional Machine learning techniques like Sup-port Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) for fault Identification
Here dataset of Case Western Reserve Univeristy has been used to verify the Methodology.
