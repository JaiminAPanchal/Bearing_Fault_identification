There are four different files present in this folder, each file was created in Google Colab Notebook.

The code uses StockWell transform to denoise the one dimensional signal and convert it into time frequency image. (Stockwell_Transform.ipynb)

The dataset used for this project is from Case Western Reserve University's Datacentre, which is publicly available and benchmark dataset for testing new methodologies for fault identification inside ball bearings. It is highly imbalanced dataset, hence Geometrical Augmentation is used to increase its size and to balance it.(Data_Augmentation.ipynb)

Application of Generative Adversarial Networks is explored in this project, the images formed using Stockwell transform is fed to this GAN model for generating Artificial Images.(DCGAN_for_bearing_fault_identification_GITHUB.ipynb)

All the images generated should be seperated into the seperate folder of datasets with the subfolder of different classes before using Convolutional Neural Network as feature extractor. A feature vector will be made which is then fed to ML models for fault classification. (CNN_Feature_extractor_to_ML_models.ipynb)
